# Introduction #

Use this page to add requests for components.  Put each new component in a new heading, and describe the basic functionality of the component in the body.  Include as much information as possible/necessary.

## Sample Component Request ##

The Sample component should work like X.  It should have a public api that consists of the following:
  * prop1:type
  * someMethod( arg1:type ):returnType

It would be great if it supported styles X, Y, and Z.

The following events would be nice as well
  * someEvent:EventType
    * prop1:type - Detailed information about X

## Vertical TabNavigator ##
An extension of the SuperTabNavigator already in flexlib (or maybe just an extension of normal TabNavigator) that would lay out the tabs along the left or right side of the navigator. Should work exactly the same as the normal tab navigator, but add one property, like tabBarPlacement, which can either be left, right, top, or bottom.
